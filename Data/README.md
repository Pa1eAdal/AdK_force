For readability, please refer to the 'readable_' files.
The readable data contain the average values and standard deviations derived from raw data and bootstrap analysis.
The plotting scripts are also contained in the 'fig' subdirectories.
Each subdirectory includes both the data and the corresponding script needed to generate the figure.
